# NgxGrowthbook

This project was generated using [Nx](https://nx.dev) and is heavily based on the [Weiyuan Lane](https://weiyuan-lane.github.io/)'s [growthbook-remote-config](https://github.com/Weiyuan-Lane/growthbook-remote-config) project.

## Running and working

runs `nx build ngx-growthbook --watch` and `nx serve ngx-growthbook-sample` to live development and testing. The `ngx-growthbook` is the library itself, and the `ngx-growthbook-sample` is a dummy project using the library.

## Current supported features

Currently, this library supports only the 'feature flag' feature, allowing its users to show/hide behaviors
